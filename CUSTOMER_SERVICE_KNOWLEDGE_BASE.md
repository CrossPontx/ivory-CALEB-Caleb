## Advanced FAQ - Real User Questions

### Billing & Refund Questions

#### "I was charged twice for the same subscription!"

**What to do:**
1. Check your email for two separate receipts
2. Verify both charges are for the same period
3. Check if one is from Apple and one from Stripe (if you subscribed on both platforms)
4. Contact support immediately with:
   - Both transaction IDs
   - Screenshots of charges
   - Your account email
5. Duplicate charges are refunded within 5-10 business days

**Common cause:** Subscribing on iOS app, then again on web. These are separate subscriptions through different payment processors.

**Prevention:** Only subscribe on one platform. Your subscription works across all platforms.

#### "I cancelled my subscription but was still charged!"

**Why this happens:**
- Cancellation takes effect at END of current billing period
- If you cancelled on January 20 but billing date is January 15, you'll be charged February 15
- Must cancel BEFORE next billing date to avoid charge

**What to do:**
1. Check cancellation confirmation email
2. Verify cancellation date vs billing date
3. If cancelled before billing date and still charged, contact support
4. Provide cancellation confirmation and charge receipt

**iOS specific:** Cancellation must be done through iPhone Settings → Subscriptions, not in the app.

#### "I want a refund for credits I didn't use"

**Policy:** Credits are non-refundable under all circumstances.

**Why:**
- Credits are digital goods consumed upon purchase
- Like buying movie tickets - no refund if you don't watch
- Clearly stated at purchase and in Terms of Service

**Exceptions (rare):**
- Technical error prevented credit delivery
- Duplicate purchase due to system error
- Unauthorized charge on your account

**Not eligible for refund:**
- Changed your mind
- Didn't like AI results
- Forgot you had credits
- Deleting your account
- Cancelling subscription

#### "My subscription renewed but I didn't get my monthly credits"

**Troubleshooting steps:**

1. **Check transaction history:**
   - Go to Settings → Credits → Transaction History
   - Look for "Monthly subscription renewal" entry
   - Credits should appear within 5 minutes of charge

2. **Verify payment succeeded:**
   - Check email for payment receipt
   - If payment failed, subscription didn't renew
   - Update payment method and retry

3. **Log out and back in:**
   - Sometimes credits don't display until refresh
   - Force close app and reopen
   - Clear browser cache (web)

4. **Check subscription status:**
   - Go to Settings → Billing
   - Verify subscription shows "Active"
   - Check renewal date matches today

5. **Still missing?**
   - Wait 30 minutes (processing delay)
   - Contact support with transaction ID
   - Credits will be manually added

#### "I subscribed on iOS but don't see Pro features on web"

**This is normal.** Your subscription works across all platforms automatically.

**If features aren't showing:**
1. Make sure you're logged into the same account
2. Check email address matches on both platforms
3. Log out and back in on web
4. Clear browser cache
5. Wait 5-10 minutes for sync

**Technical reason:** Subscription status syncs from Apple/Stripe to our database. Usually instant, but can take a few minutes.

#### "Can I get a refund if I delete my account?"

**No.** Account deletion does not entitle you to any refunds.

**What you lose:**
- All unused credits (no refund)
- Remaining subscription time (no refund)
- All saved designs and data
- All bookings and history

**Before deleting:**
- Use remaining credits
- Cancel subscription (stops future charges)
- Export your data
- Complete or cancel pending bookings
- Withdraw wallet balance (nail techs)

**Subscription continues:** If you delete account but don't cancel subscription, you'll still be charged monthly even though you can't use the service.



### Credit & Generation Issues

#### "The AI generated a design I hate. Can I get my credit back?"

**No.** Credits are consumed when generation starts, regardless of result quality.

**Why:**
- AI processing costs money (OpenAI API charges)
- We're charged whether you like the result or not
- Like taking a photo - film is used even if photo is bad

**What you can do:**
- Generate again with different prompt (costs another credit)
- Use drawing tools to edit the design
- Be more specific in your prompts
- Use reference images for better results
- Try different design parameters

**Tips for better results:**
- Use high-quality hand photos
- Be very specific: "pastel pink French tips with gold glitter accent on ring finger"
- Include style keywords: "minimalist", "bold", "elegant", "edgy"
- Mention technique: "ombre", "marble effect", "chrome finish"
- Specify placement: "accent nail", "all nails", "alternating"

#### "I clicked generate but nothing happened and I lost a credit!"

**This is a bug. Contact support immediately.**

**What to include:**
1. Exact time it happened
2. What you were trying to generate
3. Screenshot of credit history showing deduction
4. Screenshot showing no design was created
5. Device and browser/app version

**We will:**
- Investigate the failed generation
- Refund the credit to your account
- Fix the bug if it's on our end

**Common causes:**
- Server timeout (our fault - credit refunded)
- Internet disconnected mid-generation (your fault - no refund, but we're lenient)
- Browser crashed (your fault - no refund)
- App crashed (our fault - credit refunded)

#### "My credits disappeared!"

**Possible reasons:**

1. **Someone else accessed your account:**
   - Change password immediately
   - Check transaction history for unauthorized use
   - Contact support to investigate

2. **You forgot you used them:**
   - Check transaction history
   - Each generation costs 1 credit
   - Easy to lose track if generating many designs

3. **Subscription expired:**
   - You don't lose credits when subscription expires
   - But you can't earn new monthly credits
   - Check if you're confusing "monthly allocation" with "total balance"

4. **Account was compromised:**
   - Enable two-factor authentication (if available)
   - Change password
   - Review account activity
   - Contact support

5. **Database error (rare):**
   - Contact support with last known balance
   - We can check server logs
   - Credits will be restored if error confirmed

#### "Can I transfer credits to my friend?"

**No.** Credits are non-transferable between accounts.

**Why:**
- Prevents credit reselling/black market
- Prevents account fraud
- Keeps pricing fair for everyone

**Alternative:** Use referral program. When your friend signs up with your code, you both get credits.

#### "I have 100 credits but it says I need to subscribe to generate designs"

**This shouldn't happen.** Credits work regardless of subscription status.

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Log out and back in
2. Check if you're on a restricted page
3. Verify credits show in top navigation
4. Try from different page (Capture page)
5. Clear cache and cookies
6. Try different browser/device

**If still blocked:**
- This is a bug
- Contact support immediately
- Include screenshot
- We'll fix and compensate for inconvenience

#### "Why do some features cost credits and others don't?"

**Costs 1 Credit:**
- AI design generation from text prompt
- Applying design to your hand photo
- Generating design from uploaded inspiration
- Any AI processing that uses OpenAI API

**Free:**
- Browsing designs
- Saving designs to collections
- Sharing designs
- Booking appointments
- Messaging nail techs
- Uploading photos (without AI processing)
- Editing profile
- Drawing on existing designs (manual editing)
- Viewing your saved designs

**Why:** AI processing costs us money (OpenAI charges per API call). Everything else is just database storage and bandwidth, which is cheap.



### Booking & Nail Tech Issues

#### "The nail tech accepted my booking but never showed up. Can I get a refund?"

**Yes, absolutely.**

**What to do:**
1. Document the no-show:
   - Take screenshot of confirmed booking
   - Note the date, time, and location
   - Save any messages with the tech
2. Contact support within 24 hours
3. Provide booking ID and evidence
4. Full refund processed within 3-5 business days

**What happens to the tech:**
- Warning on first offense
- Suspension after 2 no-shows
- Permanent ban after 3 no-shows
- Affects their rating and search ranking

**Prevention:**
- Message tech day before to confirm
- Check tech's reviews for reliability
- Book with highly-rated techs

#### "The nail tech did a terrible job. The design looks nothing like what I requested."

**This is between you and the nail tech.** We're a marketplace, not the service provider.

**What we can do:**
- Facilitate communication between you and tech
- Allow you to leave honest review
- Investigate if tech violated platform rules

**What we cannot do:**
- Force tech to redo the work
- Refund for quality issues (service was provided)
- Mediate disputes about artistic interpretation

**Your options:**
1. **Communicate with tech:**
   - Message them about concerns
   - Many techs will offer to fix issues
   - Be respectful and specific

2. **Leave honest review:**
   - Rate your experience
   - Describe what went wrong
   - Help other clients make informed decisions
   - Tech can respond to your review

3. **Request refund from tech directly:**
   - Some techs offer satisfaction guarantees
   - This is between you and them
   - We don't control their refund policies

4. **Report if tech violated rules:**
   - Used offensive language
   - Behaved inappropriately
   - Didn't follow safety protocols
   - We'll investigate and take action

**Remember:** AI designs are previews, not guarantees. Actual results depend on:
- Nail tech's skill level
- Your natural nail condition
- Products used
- Time available
- Design complexity

#### "I booked an appointment but the tech hasn't responded in 3 days"

**Techs have 48 hours to respond.** After that, booking auto-cancels and you're refunded.

**What to do:**
1. **Wait 48 hours from booking time**
2. **Check booking status:**
   - Go to Bookings page
   - Look for status update
3. **If still pending after 48 hours:**
   - Booking should auto-cancel
   - Refund processed automatically
   - You'll receive notification

4. **If not auto-cancelled:**
   - Contact support with booking ID
   - We'll manually cancel and refund
   - Tech may be penalized for non-response

**Why techs don't respond:**
- Away on vacation (should have blocked time off)
- Missed notification
- Fully booked (should decline promptly)
- No longer active on platform
- Technical issue with notifications

**Your options:**
- Book with different tech immediately
- Don't wait for unresponsive tech
- Check tech's recent reviews for responsiveness

#### "Can I cancel a booking 2 hours before and get a refund?"

**Depends on timing:**

**24+ hours before:** Full refund, no questions asked
**Less than 24 hours:** No refund (tech's discretion)

**Why:**
- Tech has already blocked time for you
- Too late for them to book another client
- They lose income due to late cancellation

**Tech may offer refund:** Some techs are flexible, but not required.

**Exceptions (full refund):**
- Emergency (medical, family)
- Tech cancels or reschedules
- Tech no-shows
- Weather emergency
- Platform technical issue

**How to cancel:**
1. Go to Bookings page
2. Find your booking
3. Click "Cancel Booking"
4. Select reason
5. Confirm cancellation
6. Refund processed if eligible

**Best practice:** Cancel as early as possible. Techs appreciate it and may remember you positively for future bookings.

#### "The nail tech is asking me to pay cash instead of through the app"

**🚨 RED FLAG - DO NOT DO THIS.**

**Why this is against our rules:**
- Bypasses platform fees
- No payment protection for you
- No record of transaction
- Tech avoiding taxes
- You can't leave verified review
- No recourse if something goes wrong

**What to do:**
1. **Decline politely:** "I prefer to pay through the app for security"

3. **Cancel booking if they insist**
4. **Leave review warning others**

**Consequences for tech:**
- First offense: Warning
- Second offense: Suspension
- Third offense: Permanent ban

**Why techs do this:**
- Avoid 12.5% platform fee
- Avoid taxes
- Keep all money

**Why you shouldn't:**
- No payment protection
- No refund if they no-show
- No proof of payment
- Can't dispute charge
- Supports tax evasion

#### "I'm a nail tech and a client is harassing me with messages"

**You have several options:**

1. **Block the user:**
   - Go to their profile
   - Tap ⋮ menu
   - Select "Block User"
   - They can no longer message or book you

2. **Report harassment:**
   - Tap ⋮ on their message
   - Select "Report User"

   - Block them to prevent future requests

**What we do:**

- Demanding services you don't offer
- Refusing to accept your boundaries

**You are protected:** We have zero tolerance for harassment of nail techs.



### Nail Tech Specific Issues

#### "I'm a nail tech and haven't received my payout from a completed booking"

**Payout timeline:** 2 business days after booking marked complete.

**Troubleshooting:**

1. **Check booking status:**
   - Must be marked "Completed"
   - Not just "Confirmed"
   - You must click "Mark as Complete" after appointment

2. **Verify Stripe Connect setup:**
   - Go to Tech Settings → Payout Settings
   - Status must be "Active"
   - If "Pending", complete verification
   - If "Not Setup", you must set up wallet first

3. **Check payout schedule:**
   - Completed Monday → Payout Wednesday
   - Completed Friday → Payout Tuesday (next week)
   - Weekends don't count as business days

4. **Verify bank account:**
   - Check Stripe dashboard for payout status
   - May be delayed by your bank
   - Verify account details are correct

5. **Check for holds:**
   - New accounts may have 7-day hold
   - High-risk transactions may be reviewed
   - Check Stripe dashboard for details

**Still missing after 5 business days?**
- Contact support with booking ID
- We'll investigate with Stripe
- May need to verify your identity
- Payout will be released once resolved

#### "Why is the platform taking 12.5% of my booking fee?"

**This is our service fee for:**

**What you get:**
- Platform development and maintenance
- Server hosting and bandwidth
- Payment processing infrastructure
- Customer support
- Marketing and client acquisition
- AI design breakdown tool
- Booking management system
- Profile and portfolio hosting
- Search and discovery features
- Review and rating system
- Secure messaging
- Fraud protection
- Legal and compliance

**Industry comparison:**
- Uber/Lyft: 25-30%
- Airbnb: 15-20%
- Etsy: 6.5% + payment fees
- Upwork: 10-20%
- Our 12.5%: Competitive and fair

**You keep 87.5%** of every booking, plus:
- Direct client relationships
- Portfolio exposure
- Review building
- Repeat bookings
- No advertising costs

**Alternative:** Work independently with 100% of fees, but:
- No client discovery
- No payment protection
- No booking management
- No review system
- Must handle own marketing
- Must build own website
- Must handle own payment processing

#### "I've done 5 bookings and now it's asking me to subscribe. Why?"

**Free tier includes 5 bookings to try the platform.**

**After 5 bookings, you must subscribe to Business tier ($60/month) for:**
- Unlimited bookings
- 40 AI design credits per month
- Priority search placement
- Advanced analytics
- Client management tools
- Featured profile
- Premium support

**Why we require subscription:**
- Ensures serious, professional nail techs
- Covers platform costs for active users
- Provides better service quality
- Filters out casual/unreliable techs
- Funds platform improvements

**Is it worth it?**
- If you do 2+ bookings per month: Yes
- Average booking: $80
- Your take (87.5%): $70
- 2 bookings = $140 revenue
- Minus $60 subscription = $80 profit
- Plus you get 40 AI credits ($60 value)

**Can't afford it?**
- Use free tier for side income
- Upgrade when you're busier
- Consider if nail tech work is viable for you
- Platform isn't profitable for us with free-only users

#### "A client left a fake/unfair review. Can you remove it?"

**We only remove reviews that violate our policies.**

**Violations (will be removed):**
- Contains profanity or hate speech
- Personal attacks unrelated to service
- Reveals private information
- False claims (provably untrue)
- Posted by someone who didn't book you
- Spam or promotional content
- Violates Terms of Service

**Not violations (won't be removed):**
- Client didn't like the result
- Client says you were late (even if you disagree)
- Client says design didn't match (subjective)
- Low rating without explanation
- Honest criticism of your work

**What you can do:**
1. **Respond professionally:**
   - Address their concerns
   - Explain your perspective
   - Offer to make it right
   - Future clients will see your response

2. **Request review:**
   - If provably false, provide evidence
   - Screenshots of messages
   - Photos of actual work
   - Booking details
   - We'll investigate

3. **Build better reviews:**
   - One bad review among many good ones is okay
   - Focus on getting more positive reviews
   - Provide excellent service
   - Follow up with clients

**Example good response:**
"I'm sorry you weren't satisfied. I followed the design you requested, but I understand it didn't meet your expectations. I'd be happy to discuss how to improve for next time. Please reach out if you'd like to give me another chance."

**Example bad response:**
"This review is fake! This client is lying and trying to ruin my business! Don't believe them!"

#### "Can I offer discounts or promotions to clients?"

**Yes, but with limitations:**

**Allowed:**
- Discount codes through the app
- First-time client discounts
- Loyalty programs
- Seasonal promotions
- Package deals

**Not allowed:**
- Asking clients to pay cash outside app
- Offering discounts for paying outside app
- Bypassing platform fees
- Fake pricing (high price, then "discount" to normal)

**How to offer discounts:**
1. Set your regular service price
2. Create promotional pricing in settings
3. Mention in your profile
4. Apply at booking confirmation
5. Platform fee still applies to discounted price

**Example:**
- Regular price: $100
- Promotional price: $80
- Client pays: $80
- Platform fee (12.5%): $10
- You receive: $70

**Why we allow it:**
- Helps you attract clients
- Builds your business
- Competitive pricing
- Your choice how to price services

**Why we don't allow cash payments:**
- No payment protection
- Tax evasion

#### "My designs aren't saving / keep disappearing"

**Possible causes:**

**1. Not logged in:**
- Designs only save when logged in
- Guest mode doesn't save anything
- Log in before generating

**2. Storage quota exceeded:**
- Free users: 50 saved designs max
- Pro users: Unlimited
- Delete old designs to make room
- Or upgrade to Pro

**3. Browser issues (web):**
- Clear browser cache
- Disable ad blockers

#### "Why is the AI so slow? It's taking forever to generate."

**Normal generation time:** 2-5 seconds

**If taking longer:**

**10-30 seconds:**
- Server is busy (high traffic)
- Complex prompt requires more processing
- Large image file being processed
- This is still acceptable

**30-60 seconds:**
- Possible network issues
- Server overload
- Check your internet speed
- Try again in a few minutes

**Over 60 seconds:**
- Something is wrong
- Refresh the page
- Try again
- Contact support if persists

**Factors affecting speed:**
- Time of day (peak hours slower)
- Your internet speed
- Image file size
- Prompt complexity
- Server load

**Peak hours (slower):**
- Weekday evenings: 6-10pm
- Weekend afternoons: 12-6pm
- Holiday periods

**Off-peak hours (faster):**
- Early morning: 6-9am
- Late night: 11pm-2am
- Weekday mornings: 9am-12pm

**Tips for faster generation:**
- Use smaller image files
- Generate during off-peak hours
- Use simpler prompts
- Ensure strong internet connection

#### "The AI keeps generating the same design over and over"

**This is a known issue with AI models.**

**Why it happens:**
- AI uses your prompt as seed
- Same prompt = similar results
- AI has learned patterns
- Some prompts are too generic

**How to get variety:**

1. **Change your prompt significantly:**
   - Don't just add one word
   - Completely rephrase
   - Add specific details
   - Use different style keywords

2. **Add randomness:**
   - "Surprise me with..."
   - "Unique take on..."
   - "Creative interpretation of..."
   - "Unexpected design featuring..."

3. **Be more specific:**
   - Instead of: "pink nails"
   - Try: "dusty rose matte finish with gold foil accent on ring finger"

4. **Use different reference images:**
   - Upload different inspiration photos
   - AI will generate based on new reference

5. **Try different design parameters:**
   - Change nail shape
   - Change base color
   - Change style category
   - Change accent options

**Example progression:**
- Attempt 1: "French tips" → Generic white tips
- Attempt 2: "French tips with glitter" → White tips with glitter
- Attempt 3: "Reverse French tips with rose gold glitter and matte top coat" → Unique design

#### "Can I use Ivory's Choice designs for my nail salon's Instagram?"

- Different subscription systems
- Cannot be merged

**What to do:**
1. **Cancel one subscription:**
   - Keep the one you prefer

- Web: If you prefer Stripe/credit card
- Functionally identical

#### "I'm a nail tech. A client booked me, I did the service, but they're disputing the charge with their bank."

**This is called a chargeback.**

**What happens:**

1. **Client disputes charge with bank:**
   - Claims service not provided
   - Claims unauthorized charge
   - Claims different amount charged

2. **Bank reverses the charge:**
   - Money taken from platform
   - Platform takes money from your payout
   - You lose the payment

3. **We investigate:**
   - Review booking details
   - Check messages
   - Look for proof of service
   - Contact both parties

4. **Dispute resolution:**
   - If you provided service: We fight chargeback
   - If you have proof: We submit to bank

**Why no unsend:**
- Technical limitations
- Messages may already be read
- Notifications already sent
- Database architecture

**Prevention:**

### Subscription & Billing Edge Cases

#### "I cancelled my subscription but it renewed anyway. I want a full refund."

**Let's diagnose what happened:**

**Scenario 1: Cancelled too late**
- Cancellation takes effect at END of billing period
- If you cancelled on Jan 20 but billing date is Jan 15
- You'll be charged Feb 15 (next billing date)
- Must cancel BEFORE billing date

**Solution:** Not eligible for refund. Cancellation will take effect after this period.

**Scenario 2: Cancellation didn't process**
- Technical error
- Didn't complete cancellation steps
- Cancelled on wrong platform

**Solution:** 
1. Check cancellation confirmation email
2. If no email, cancellation didn't complete
3. If you have email, contact support for refund
4. We'll investigate and refund if error confirmed

**Scenario 3: Cancelled on wrong platform**
- Subscribed on iOS, tried to cancel on web
- Must cancel where you subscribed
- iOS: Cancel through iPhone Settings
- Web: Cancel through Billing page

**Solution:** Cancel on correct platform. May be eligible for refund if you can prove you tried to cancel.

**Scenario 4: Auto-renewal after resubscribing**
- Cancelled, then resubscribed
- Forgot you resubscribed
- Check subscription history

**Solution:** Not eligible for refund. You resubscribed.

**How to get refund:**

#### "I want to pause my subscription for 2 months while I'm on vacation"

**We don't offer subscription pausing.**

**Your options:**

**Option 1: Cancel and resubscribe**
- Cancel before vacation
- Lose monthly credit allocation
- Keep all existing credits (they never expire)
- Resubscribe when you return
- Start fresh billing cycle

**Pros:**
- Don't pay while away
- Credits are waiting when you return

**Cons:**
- Lose monthly credit allocation
- Have to resubscribe manually
- May forget to resubscribe

**Option 2: Keep subscription active**
- Continue paying monthly
- Credits accumulate while away
- Come back to large credit balance
- No interruption

**Pros:**
- Credits waiting when you return
- No need to resubscribe

- Keep Business subscription if you have bookings
- Cancel if completely unavailable for extended period

#### "I'm being charged $20/month but I thought I subscribed to the $60 Business plan"

**Possible explanations:**

**1. You're on Pro, not Business:**
- Check Settings → Billing
- Verify which plan you're subscribed to
- Pro = $20/month (15 credits)
- Business = $60/month (40 credits)

**Solution:** Upgrade to Business if you want that plan.

**2. You subscribed to wrong plan:**
- Easy to click wrong button
- Check subscription details
- Cancel and subscribe to correct plan

**Solution:** 
1. Cancel current subscription
2. Wait for period to end
3. Subscribe to Business plan
4. Or contact support for immediate switch

**3. Promotional pricing:**
- First month discount
- Will increase to $60 next month
- Check subscription details

**Solution:** This is normal, wait for next billing.

**4. You're a client, not a nail tech:**
- Business plan is for nail techs only
- Clients can only subscribe to Pro ($20)
- If you're a nail tech, change user type first

**Solution:** 
1. Go to Settings → Account
2. Change user type to "Nail Technician"
3. Complete tech profile
4. Then subscribe to Business

**How to verify:**
- Settings → Billing → Current Plan
- Should clearly show plan name and price
- Shows next billing date and amount

#### "I bought credits on iOS but they're not showing on the web version"

**This shouldn't happen. Credits sync across all platforms.**

**Troubleshooting:**

- Refresh the page
- Clear browser cache
- Try again

**Step 4: Check credit history**

**Common causes:**
- Using different accounts on iOS vs web

- Sync delay
- Technical glitch

**Prevention:**
- Use same login method everywhere
- Wait a few minutes after purchase
- Check credit balance before panicking

#### "Can I gift my Pro subscription to my friend?"

**No, subscriptions cannot be transferred or gifted.**

**Why:**
- Subscriptions tied to specific account
- Payment method linked to subscriber
- Technical limitations
- Prevents fraud/abuse

**Alternatives:**

**1. Gift credits (indirectly):**
- Can't directly gift
- But can share referral code
- They get bonus credits on signup
- You get credits for referring them

**2. Pay for their subscription:**
- Give them money/gift card
- They subscribe with their own account
- You're not directly involved

**3. Share your account (not recommended):**
- Against Terms of Service
- Security risk
- Can't both use simultaneously
- Account may be banned

**4. Buy them credit packages:**
- Can't directly purchase for them
- But can give them money to buy credits
- They purchase with their own account

**Best option:** Share your referral code so they get bonus credits when signing up.



### AI & Design Quality Issues

#### "The AI generated a design with 6 fingers. This is unacceptable."

**AI limitations are real and acknowledged.**

**Why this happens:**
- AI doesn't "understand" hands
- Trained on millions of images
- Sometimes makes anatomical errors
- More common with complex poses
- Known limitation of current AI technology

**What we can do:**
- Regenerate for free (contact support with screenshot)
- Refund the credit
- Note the issue for AI improvements

**What we can't do:**
- Guarantee perfect anatomy every time
- Make AI "understand" hands
- Prevent all errors

**How to minimize errors:**

**Photo tips:**
- Use clear, well-lit photos
- Keep all fingers visible
- Avoid overlapping fingers
- Use simple hand poses
- Straight-on angle works best

**Prompt tips:**
- Don't mention finger count (confuses AI)
- Focus on nail design, not hand
- Keep prompts simple
- Avoid complex hand descriptions

**When it happens:**
1. Don't use that generation
2. Try again with different photo

#### "The AI keeps making the nails way too long/short/wrong shape"

**AI interprets your prompt and photo.**

**Solutions:**

**1. Be explicit in prompt:**
- "Short square nails"
- "Long stiletto nails"
- "Medium length almond shape"
- "Natural length oval nails"

**2. Use design parameters:**
- Select nail shape in dropdown
- Choose length preference
- AI will follow these settings

**3. Use reference photo:**
- Upload photo of desired length/shape
- AI will match the reference
- More accurate than text description

**4. Edit your hand photo:**
- Use photo with nails already at desired length
- AI will maintain that length
- Best for accurate results

**5. Use drawing tools:**
- Generate design
- Manually adjust with drawing tools
- Reshape nails as needed

**Why AI struggles:**
- "Long" is subjective
- Different nail shapes have different proportions
- Photo angle affects perception
- AI makes best guess

**Best practice:**
- Use design parameters (most reliable)
- Upload reference image (second best)
- Be very specific in prompt (third best)

#### "The colors in the AI design don't match what I asked for"

**Color interpretation issues:**

**Problem 1: Color names are subjective**
- "Pink" could be hot pink, baby pink, dusty rose
- "Blue" could be navy, sky blue, teal
- AI interprets based on training data

**Solution:**
- Use specific color names: "dusty rose", "navy blue", "mint green"
- Use hex codes: "#FFB6C1" for light pink
- Reference specific shades: "Essie Ballet Slippers pink"

**Problem 2: Lighting affects colors**
- Your screen brightness
- Color calibration
- Photo lighting
- AI's color interpretation

**Solution:**
- View on multiple devices
- Adjust screen brightness
- Consider lighting when showing tech

**Problem 3: AI creative interpretation**
- AI may add complementary colors
- May adjust for aesthetic reasons
- May interpret "accent" differently

**Solution:**
- Be explicit: "ONLY pink and white, no other colors"
- Specify: "solid color, no gradients"
- Regenerate if not satisfied

**Problem 4: Color blending**
- Ombre and gradients may not match expectation
- AI's blend may differ from your vision

**Solution:**
- Use reference image
- Show exact gradient you want
- Be very specific about blend points

**Tips for accurate colors:**
1. Use specific color names
2. Mention finish: "matte", "glossy", "metallic"
3. Specify saturation: "bright", "pastel", "muted"
4. Reference brands: "OPI Lincoln Park After Dark"
5. Use hex codes for precision

#### "Can the AI do [specific complex technique]?"

**AI capabilities and limitations:**

**✅ AI can do well:**
- French tips (classic and variations)
- Ombre/gradient effects
- Glitter and sparkle
- Solid colors
- Simple patterns (stripes, dots)
- Floral designs
- Geometric patterns
- Marble effects
- Chrome/metallic finishes

**⚠️ AI struggles with:**
- Intricate hand-painted details
- Specific character designs
- Text and letters (often garbled)
- Symmetry across all nails
- 3D elements (gems, charms)
- Exact brand product replication
- Complex nail art techniques

**❌ AI cannot do:**
- Guarantee exact replication
- Understand physics of nail products
- Know what's technically possible
- Account for nail tech skill level
- Predict real-world results

**Remember:**
- AI creates PREVIEWS, not instructions
- Real results depend on nail tech skill
- Some designs may not be physically possible
- Use AI Design Breakdown for technique guidance

**For nail techs:**
- Use AI Design Breakdown tool
- Get step-by-step instructions
- Understand techniques needed
- Assess if design is achievable
- Communicate limitations to client

#### "The AI design looks great but my nail tech says it's impossible to do"

**This is common and expected.**

**Why:**
- AI doesn't understand nail physics
- AI doesn't know product limitations
- AI creates idealized versions
- Some designs require hours of work
- Some techniques don't exist in real life

**What to do:**

**1. Trust your nail tech:**
- They know what's possible
- They understand product limitations
- They've done thousands of nails
- They're the expert

**2. Ask for modifications:**
- "Can we simplify this?"
- "What's the closest you can do?"
- "Which parts are achievable?"

**3. Use AI Design Breakdown:**
- Nail tech can generate breakdown
- See difficulty level
- See estimated time
- See required techniques
- Assess feasibility

**4. Adjust expectations:**
- AI is inspiration, not blueprint
- Real nails have limitations
- Some designs take 3+ hours
- Some require specialized skills

**5. Collaborate:**
- Show tech the AI design
- Discuss what's possible
- Create modified version together
- Tech can use as inspiration

**Common "impossible" elements:**
- Perfect symmetry across all nails
- Microscopic details
- Certain color combinations (products don't exist)
- 3D elements that would break off
- Designs requiring 4+ hours

**Realistic approach:**
- Use AI for inspiration
- Let tech interpret creatively
- Focus on overall vibe, not exact replication
- Trust the professional
